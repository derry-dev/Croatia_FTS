# SHINY APP DOCUMENTATION
# Database is queried by import.R, which compiles data from different schemas and
# creates aggregated entries before writing files to csv in the 'data' folder.
# Required package libraries and csv files are read by data.R.
# The functions to draw plots for each metric is contained in global.R, which
# takes data from tables read by data.R.
# In ui.R, you can specify external JavaScript and CSS files for usage, which must
# be placed in the 'www' folder, along with any images used.
# The shiny app itself requires ui.R and server.R, in which we define initial UI
# elements in ui.R and define behaviour when UI is interacted with in server.R.
