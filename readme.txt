# VERSION 1.8 --"It Just Works"-- NOTES:

# Added swanky new TMA sector polygons to conflict map

# Centralised airport/sector lists for ease of adding new airports/sectors to list

# Converted seperation distances in Conflict table to NM/ft from m

# Increased plot font size for better visibility

# Removed sector filtering from SQL scripts, filtering is now done entirely in plotting functions
# Removed view button, now plots render automatically on selection change

# Some adaptations to accomodate future PBN data

Dear Rob,
I made the required tweaks for it to work on your local Rstudio and postgres database (fingers crossed)
Best,
Derry
